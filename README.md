HTML-Outline
============

A repository to hold the HTML Outline assignment.

Adding an HTML Outline of the page https://firstlook.org/theintercept/

The html of the original web page was run through the HTML outliner at
http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/ to get the outline of the site:

    I produced the new HTML5 Outline in InterceptOutline.html and ran it
    through the same outliner and received a clean outline back.

    The one surprise I got was the the <nav> element needs to contain a heading
    in order not to be untitled. I picked up that little piece of info from the stackoverflow web page.
